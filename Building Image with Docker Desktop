## Build the Docker Image in Docker Desktop

Now that your Dockerfile is ready, letâ€™s build it using Docker Desktop:

1. **Open Docker Desktop**:
   - Launch Docker Desktop on your computer.
   - Make sure it is running without any issues.

2. **Open Docker Dashboard**:
   - In Docker Desktop, click on **Dashboard** to view your containers, images, and other Docker resources.

3. **Add a New Build**:
   - Click on **Images** in the left panel.
   - There should be a button labeled **Build**, or alternatively, you may have an option that looks like **Create New Image**.
   - Select the folder icon or **Browse** to locate your GitHub repository that contains the Dockerfile.

4. **Select the Dockerfile Path**:
   - Navigate to the folder where your Dockerfile is saved (i.e., your GitHub repository directory).
   - Ensure that Docker Desktop finds and uses the correct Dockerfile.

5. **Name Your Image**:
   - Assign a name and optionally a tag to the Docker image (e.g., `Registery/example:latest`).

6. **Click Build**:
   - Click **Build** to start building the image.
   - Docker Desktop will use the Dockerfile to build the image. This might take a few minutes as it will download dependencies and install UniFi.

## Step 3: Verify the Build

Once the image is built:

1. Go to **Images** in Docker Desktop.
2. You should see the image you just built listed there.
3. Verify that the name and tag are correct.
