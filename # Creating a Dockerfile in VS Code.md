# Creating a Dockerfile in VS Code

To create a Dockerfile in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Open VS Code** and make sure you are in your project folder where you want to create the Dockerfile.
2. **Create a New File**:
   - Press `Cmd + N` (on macOS) to create a new file.
   - Alternatively, you can right-click in the Explorer pane and choose **New File**.
3. **Name the File**:
   - Save the new file by pressing `Cmd + S`.
   - Name it **Dockerfile** without any extensions. Make sure itâ€™s exactly "Dockerfile" (case-sensitive), as Docker expects this convention.
4. **VS Code Docker Extension (Optional)**:
   - VS Code has a **Docker Extension** that can make working with Dockerfiles easier. If you haven't installed it, you can do so from the Extensions view in VS Code.
   - The extension adds syntax highlighting and linting for Dockerfiles.

After creating the **Dockerfile**, write the Docker configuration desired into the new file, and save the file in your repository.
